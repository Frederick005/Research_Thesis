The project aims to modify the Radar sensor Model of the Carla sensor model so that it returns the IDs of the objects detected. This labeled data is then processed and DBSCAN is applied to it so that it can be easily used for machine learning algorithms. This includes:

1)	Building Carla on Windows and Linux systems and seeing which is more suited for Carla.

2)	Analyzing the preexisting radar and lidar code in the Carla Simulator (C++) to understand how to make changes to sensor models.

3)	 Modifying Radar sensor code (C++) and adding the feature that enables it to return object IDs. 

4)	Designing and creating scenarios in Carla (python) and collecting Simulated data. 

5)	Filtering stationary and moving objects.

6)	Performing clustering of the data using DBSCAN.
